    Reactive Programming
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Reactive Programming = Non-Blocking (async) +  Event Driven.


        Synchronous way opf doing it
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        1000 records in a database
                DAO      to retrive all data
                Service     soem computation happens
                Controller      collect this data
                                        and give to the UI 

                                                                UI receive the data and put it on the screnn

        Asynchronous way of doing it
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        1000 records in a database
                DAO      to retrive all data
                Service     soem computation happens (a thread can be created to process the data)
                Controller      collect this data
                                        and give to the UI

        Reactive Programming (Evetn Driven + Asynchronous) way of doing it

        1000 records in a database
                DAO      to retrive all data
                Service     soem computation happens (Streams API and Observable Pattern)
                Controller      collect the Observable
                                        and give to the UI 
                                                                UI receive the observable and 
                                                                can subscribe to his observable.

                        Observable ---------------------------->  observer (the one who subscribes)

            just(T item) − Returns an Observable that signals the given (constant reference) item and then completes.

            fromIterable(Iterable source) − Converts an Iterable sequence into an ObservableSource that emits the items in the sequence.

            fromArray(T... items) − Converts an Array into an ObservableSource that emits the items in the Array.

            fromCallable(Callable supplier) − Returns an Observable that, when an observer subscribes to it, invokes a function you specify and then emits the value returned from that function.

            fromFuture(Future future) − Converts a Future into an ObservableSource.

            interval(long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit) − Returns an Observable that emits a 0L after the initialDelay and ever increasing numbers after each period of time thereafter.

            create
                Creates an Observable from scratch and allows observer method to call programmatically.

            Defer
                Do not create an Observable until an observer subscribes. Creates a fresh observable for each observer.

            Empty/Never/Throw
                Creates an Observable with limited behavior.


        Type of Observables
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Flowable<T>

                    Emits 0 or n items and terminates with an success or an error event. Supports backpressure, which allows to control how fast a source emits items.

            Observable<T>

                    Emits 0 or n items and terminates with an success or an error event.

            Single<T>

                    Emits either a single item or an error event. The reactive version of a method call.

            Maybe<T>

                    Succeeds with an item, or no item, or errors. The reactive version of an Optional.

            Completable

                    Either completes with an success or with an error event. It never emits items. The reactive version of a Runnable.

            RxJava 2	    Reactor	
            --------------------------------------------------------
            Completable	    N/A	    
            Maybe<T>	    Mono<T>	
            Single<T>	    N/A
             Observable<T>	N/A
            Flowable<T>	    Flux<T>	

            Flowable and Flux have very similar API. Obviously, they both support basic 
            operators like map(), filter(), flatMap(), as well as more advanced ones.

            RxJava 2.x still support Java 6 as it is widely used on Android. 
            Reactor, on the other hand, targets Java 8+. 

            We are free to use Reactor without Spring framework. 
            We can also use Spring framework without Reactor. 
            But it just so happens that they integrate very tightly and Spring WebFlux uses Mono and Flux extensively.

            Thus leaves no significance to use RxJava on Spring though it is possible.
